What this project does: This project is a numbers game where the player is given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals each with a differnt value.  The player has to click on any of the four crystals to cummulatively add the crystal values to equal the randomly generated number at the start of the game.  The player wins when all of the crystal values add up to the randomly generated number.  The player loses if the crystal values surpass the randomly generated number.  Wins and losses are recorded.  Each time the player wins or loses, a new random number is generated and new random values are given to the crystals.  The number of guesses are reset to zero.
